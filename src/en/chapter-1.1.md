## 1.1. How Computer Represents Numbers?

*From fingers to bits*

----

## How do Human Count?

Before computers,

Humans were already counting.

> How did we start counting in the first place?

----

## Counting with Fingers!

Human have 10 fingers:

![10 fingers](https://www.emoji.family/api/emojis/1f450/noto/png/256)
<!-- .element: style="text-align:center" -->

> So, counting in group of 10 feels natural to us.

----

## Decimal

We use *decimal* symbols (digits):

> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

After 9, we run out of symbols, then:
* Go back to 0 <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
* Carry 1 to the next position <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->

<br/>
<br/>

**This rule is not about math, it's about representation.** <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->

----

## What does "Decimal" Mean?

Decimal means:

* **10** symbols
* Each position is worth a power of **10**
The values comes from the **position**.

> `345 = 300 + 40 + 5`
> `    = 3 × 10² + 4 × 10¹ + 5 × 10⁰`

----

<!-- .slide: class="center" -->
## Is Decimal the ONLY Way to Count?

----

<!-- .slide: class="center" -->
> Decimal is a human choice.

----

## Computer's Choice

If **Decimal** comes from human hands,

What kind of "hands" do computers have?

> Computers also have a choice.
> But their choice is limited by -- **hardware**.

----

## Hardware Limits the Choice

At the lowest level, a computer can only reliably tell:
* ON / OFF
* High / Low
* 1 / 0

> This makes **binary** a natural choice.

----

## Binary

Computers use binary digits:

> 0 1

Just like **decimal**:
* There are only 2 symbols
* Each position has a weight (a power of 2)
The value also comes from the **position**:

`1010 = 1 × 2³ + 0 × 2² + 1 × 2¹ + 0 × 2⁰`

----

## Hexadecimal

Just like **decimal** and **binary**:
* Hexadecimal has 16 symbols: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F
* Each position has a weight (a power of 16)
The value also comes from the **position**:

`12A = 1 × 16² + 2 × 16¹ + 10 × 16⁰`
So, binary and hexadecimal follow the same idea as decimal.

----

<!-- .slide: class="center" -->
### This shared idea has a name -- Positional Numeral System

----

## Different Representations

We write numbers using symbols:
* 42
* 101010
* 2A
They look different, but can represent the same value.

> What makes them different?

----

## What's NOT the Difference?

The difference is NOT:
* The value
* The idea of counting

----

## Number of Symbols Matters

Each representation uses a different set of symbols:
* Decimal uses 10 symbols

  → `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9`

* Binary uses 2 symbols

  → `0 1`

* Hexadecimal uses 16 symbols

  → `0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F`

This is called:

> The **Base (Radix)** of a Number System

----

## Base Notation

Any number expressed in base 𝑏 can be represented as follows:

$$
(d_n d_{n-1} \dots d_1 d_0)_b
$$

| Base | Digits                          | Notation   |
|:----:|:-------------------------------:|:----------:|
| 2    | 0 1                             | (1010)₂    |
| 10   | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9             | (42)₁₀     |
| 16   | 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F | (2A)₁₆     |

## How Computer Stores Numbers?

----

## Numbers in Binary

We know that numbers are represented in binary digits.

Inside a computer, binary digits are represented as **bits**.
`Digits :   1    0    1    0`

`           ↓    ↓    ↓    ↓`

`Bits   :   1    0    1    0`

> Where do these bits live?

----

## Bits Live in Memory

Bits are stored in **memory** in groups. A group of 8 bits is called a **byte**.

Memory is a long sequence of bytes:

```
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| byte 0 | byte 1 | byte 2 | byte 3 | byte 4 |  ....  | byte N |
+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
↓↓↓↓↓↓↓↓
10100101
```
<!-- .element: style="text-align:center" -->

Memory has order, bits are stored next to each other.

In real program, we store many numbers in memory.

> So, we need a way to know **where one number ends and the next one begins**.

----

## A Natural Idea

Numbers can be:
* small: `123`
* large: `23456789`
Why no use:
* fewer bits for small numbers
* more bits for large numbers?

> This sounds efficient, right?

----

## A Problem with Variable Length

If numbers use different numbers of bits,

How do we find the next numbers?

> To find the 10th number, do we have to count from the beginning?

----

<!-- .slide: class="center" -->
### What if each number uses the same number of bits?

----

## Fixed-size Numbers

With fixed-size numbers, the position of each number is predictable.
Fixed size solves:

> Where is the next number?

But we still need to choose:

> How many bits per number?

----

## Bit-width

The number of bits used for one number is called its **bit-width**.
Common choices:

```text
  bit-width | bits
------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
    8-bit   | ▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢
   16-bit   | ▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢
   32-bit   | ▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢
   64-bit   | ▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢
```

> Why not always use 64-bits?

----

## Bit-width is a Trade-off

More bits means:
* larger range
* more memory
Fewer bits means:
* smaller range
* less memory

----

## A Quick Thought

If we store 1,000,000 numbers:
* 8-bit → 1MB
* 32-bit → 4MB
* 64-bit → 8MB

> Same count of numbers, different memory cost.
> This matters in real programs.

----

## Negative Numbers

So far, we can store numbers in bits.

But what about negative numbers?

How do we store:
* -1
* -10
* -100
* ...?

----

## Back to Number System

In a **Positional Numeral System**, digits represent **Place Values**, they tell us:

> How big a number is.

But digits have no idea about **direction** (positive or negative).

They only represent magnitude, no sign.

----

## Where does the Sign Come From?

If digits only represent magnitude...

Then we must use some bits to represent **sign**.

> A natural choice is -- using 1 bit to represent the **sign**

----

## Signed Numbers Representation

```text
 bit-width | bits
-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------
    8-bit  | ◌▢▢▢▢▢▢▢
   16-bit  | ◌▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢
   32-bit  | ◌▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢
   64-bit  | ◌▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢▢


  ◌ → sign
  ▢ → magnitude
```

----

## Cost of Sign

Using a sign means:
* fewer bits for magnitude
* smaller range of values
What about ...
* age
* number of students
* ...

> Do we always need the **sign**?

----

## Unsigned Numbers

If we don't need negative numbers,

We can use all bits for magnitude.

> This interpretation is called -- **Unsigned**

----

## Integer Range : Signed vs Unsigned
```text
 bit-width |    Unsigned Range    |     Signed Range
-----------+----------------------+----------------------
    8-bit  |     0 ~ 2^8  − 1     |   −2^7  ~ 2^7  − 1
   16-bit  |     0 ~ 2^16 − 1     |   −2^15 ~ 2^15 − 1
   32-bit  |     0 ~ 2^32 − 1     |   −2^31 ~ 2^31 − 1
   64-bit  |     0 ~ 2^64 − 1     |   −2^63 ~ 2^63 − 1
```
<!-- .element: style="text-align:center" -->

> Signed numbers give up **half the range** to get **sign**

----

## Non-integers

What about numbers like:
* 3.1415926
* 0.1
* -2.5
Can we just store like this?

$$
3.1415926 \times 10000000 = 31415926
$$

> What about `1/3`?

----

## A New Difficulty

If we scale numbers:
* How many decimal places do we keep?
* What if the number is very large?
* What if it is very small?

> We need to represent both **size** and **precision**

----

## What We Want?

We want a way to represent:
* very large numbers
* very small numbers
* with limited bits

----

## Scientific Notation

In math, we can write:
* `314.15926 = 3.1415926 × 10^2`
* `0.0000121 = 1.21 × 10^−5`
This is **Scientific Notation**.

$$
m \times 10^{n}, \quad 1 \le m < 10
$$


----

## Floating Point Representation

Computers do something similar:

$$
Number = Mantissa \times Base^{exponent}
$$

----

## Representation: Integer vs Floating

* Integers → exact
* Floating Point → approximate

> Floating point numbers trade exactness for range
